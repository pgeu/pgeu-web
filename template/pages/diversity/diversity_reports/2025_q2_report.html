<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

  of the PostgreSQL Europe Diversity Committee ("The Committee") during Q2 2025.

  More detailed information will be provided in the annual report prepared
  at the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past 3 months, The Committee has made good progress towards the
  goals that were identified in the 2024 annual report. 
  In particular, we have expanded our community outreach via (amongst other
  things) conference talks, social media, sharing information on the PostgreSQL
  Europe website and the PostgreSQL Wiki, and offering support and resources
  to event organisers.

  Since the previous report was presented to the board, Gülçin Yıldırım Jelínek
  has unfortunately had to step down from The Committee due to other commitments.

<h2> 1. Introduction </h2>

  quarterly report summarizing our key activities, achievements, and challenges
  during Q2 2025.
</p>
<h2> 2. Committee Changes </h2>
<p>
  Gülçin Yıldırım Jelínek has had to step down from The Committee due to other
  commitments. The Committee thanks Gülçin for her contributions, and has 
  agreed to select a replacement by 31 October 2025.
</p>
<h2> 3. Key Activities and Achievements </h2>
<p>
  Over the past quarter, The Committee has worked towards the goals identified in the 2024 annual report. 
</p>
<p>The Committee has achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Expanding Community Outreach:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Extended the lightning talk that was delivered at PgDay 2025 into a
        full length talk, and updated it to include more recent information.
        Karen delivered the <a href="https://youtu.be/Xc6ug8avX_Y">talk at
        PGConf.dev 2025</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Committee also created a <a href="https://2025.pgconf.dev/posters.html">
        poster to display at PGConf.dev 2025</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        As noted in the previous report, we created Diversity Task Force social
        media accounts on LinkedIn, Mastodon and Bluesky. We have gathered a
        small following on each of the platforms (see below for numbers), we
        have been posting approximately once per week, and have been sharing
        and interacting with other relevant posts. We plan to increase the
        frequency of posting and interaction over the following months.
        <ul>
          <li>Mastodon: 38 followers</li>
          <li>Bluesky: 30 followers</li>
          <li>LinkedIn: 91 followers</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        We added a <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Diversity">page
        related to diversity</a> to the PostgreSQL wiki, including a link back
        to the <a href="https://postgresql.eu/diversity">PostgreSQL Europe
        Diversity Task Force web pages</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>
    <b>Hidden Disabilities Sunflower Scheme:</b><br />
    With the agreement of The Board, we have signed up to the
    <a href="https://hdsunflower.com/">Hidden Disabilities Sunflower Scheme</a>.
    The membership will cover all events in the PostgreSQL Europe event series.
    Onboarding and training will begin in the coming weeks, with PGDay Lowlands
    acting as beta testers for the scheme. The main go-live is planned for PGConf.EU.
  </li>
  <li><b>Resources and Guidelines for Event Organisers:</b><br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Committee has begun to reach out to Postgres event organisers in
        Europe (whether PGEU events or organised independently) to offer support
        and resources. This has been well received. Event organisers are
        encouraged to contact us if there is anything they would like to
        discuss/request.
      </li>
      <li>
        Following discussions in the Diversity Task Force Telegram group, we
        created the draft of a collaborative document containing resources
        related to <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Presentation_accessibility">
        Accessibility Guidelines for Presentations</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        We have created a draft document detailing the benefits of live captioning
        at PostgreSQL Europe events, and including example costs of the service
        that can be incorporated into event budgets.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>PGEU Website:</b><br />
    Published 2024 annual report and plan to publish all future Diversity
    Committee reports.
  </li>
  <li><b>Metrics to Measure Scope of Issues and Track Progress:</b><br />
    This was identified as a challenge in our 2024 annual report. 
    We have begun to implement the changes required to the PGEU conference
    system that will allow us to gather diversity information 
    (on a voluntary, anonymous basis) from conference attendees and speakers.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Progress has been made on the following initiatives:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Scholarship Scheme:</b><br />
    We have merged the ticket giveaway process that we already had in place
    into a more generalised scholarship process. A draft version of the required
    documentation and form has been created in preparation for roll-out of the
    scheme. Any scholarship requests will be processed manually in the meantime.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Plans for Q3 2025</h2>
<p>
  The Committee will continue to work on the items listed above. The priority
  will be on tasks that need to be completed prior to PGConf.EU.
</p>
<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  The PostgreSQL Europe Diversity Committee remains committed to its mission
  and is making good progress on its 2025 goals. We appreciate the board’s
  support and welcome any feedback or guidance.
