<img alt="PostgreSQL Europe Diversity Task Force logo"

<p><b>Presented to the PostgreSQL Europe Board on 19 March 2025</b></p>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
  This annual report provides an overview of the activities and achievements 
  of the PostgreSQL Europe Diversity Committee ("The Committee") over the past
  12 months. The Committee has made significant progress, including the initial 
  creation of The Committee, defining its main goals, and establishing regular
  meetings. Infrastructure was set up to track The Committee’s work, social media
  channels were created, and public awareness initiatives were launched.
  Additionally, The Committee enhanced and shared rules and guidelines for CfP
  committees and conference organisers and submitted a budget request for 2025.
</p>
<p>
  Other major accomplishments include the distribution of tickets for events
  to individuals from underrepresented groups, the introduction of a 
  Diversity Celebration Board at PGConf.EU 2024, and publishing information
  about The Committee, and about PostgreSQL Europe (PGEU) diversity initiatives
  on the PGEU website.
</p>
<p>
  Despite these accomplishments, challenges remain, particularly in measuring
  the scope of issues and tracking progress due to a lack of metrics. 
  Additionally, the wide range of focus areas have impacted prioritization efforts.
  Looking ahead, we plan to focus on developing effective tracking metrics, 
  enhancing community involvement, and refining processes such as grant 
  application processes. We appreciate the board’s ongoing support and look 
  forward to another productive year.
</p>

<h2>4. Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>

Despite our successes, we encountered some challenges, including:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Lack of Metrics to Measure Scope of Issues and Track Progress:</b><br />
    The Committee currently lacks a structured system to quantify diversity-related
    concerns and measure improvements over time. Developing reliable tracking
    mechanisms will be a priority moving forward. As discussed with the PGEU
    Board, this requires changes to the PGEU conference system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Insufficient Membership Interaction:</b><br />
    Engagement among committee members has been lower than expected, which has
    affected collaboration and the implementation of initiatives. 
    Strategies will be developed to enhance participation and strengthen
    engagement efforts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Too Many Different Areas to Focus on:</b><br />
    The broad scope of diversity-related work, in conjunction with the lack
    of metrics, has made it challenging to prioritize and allocate resources
    effectively.<br />
    Just some of the areas of diversity that we may need to consider are gender,
    race, ethnicity, physical disability, neurodivergence, parental/caregiving
    status, religion, socioeconomic status.<br />
    These need to be considered in terms of conference attendees
    (ensuring that conference environments meet the needs of as many people as
    possible), conference speakers, blog post authors, hackers etc.<br />
    The Committee will work on streamlining efforts to focus on the most
    impactful initiatives.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Future Goals and Recommendations</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, The Committee plans to focus on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Gathering Data for Progress Tracking:</b><br />
    The Committee has developed and shared recommendations for diversity-related
    data that should be collected related to conference attendees and speakers.
    This requires significant enhancements to the PGEU Conference System, and
    The Committee is working with the PGEU Board to implement these changes.
    Once the changes are in place, metrics can be gathered, and the data can be
    analysed to determine baselines, set priorities and measure progress.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Enhancing Membership Engagement:</b><br />
    Implement strategies to increase participation and interaction within the
    PGEU community.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Expanding Community Outreach:</b><br />
    Strengthen communication efforts to broaden awareness and involvement.
    (Social media, email, Website and/or Wiki, presence at events etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Prioritizing Key Focus Areas:</b><br />
    Streamline efforts to concentrate on the most critical diversity initiatives
    for maximum impact. (see Gathering Data for Progress Tracking above)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Creating Scholarship Program:</b><br />
    Expand the distribution of donated tickets to people in underrepresented
    groups into a formal scholarship program, enabling potential conference
    attendees to submit request travel grants. The Committee will take inspiration
    from the processes already implemented by the PgUS Diversity Committee.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Recommendations:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Engage conference organisation teams in diversity conversations and
        initiatives, sharing The Committee's documentation, and offering The
        Committee's assistance and resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prioritise PGEU Conference System enhancements that will enable
        collection of the required data as discussed above.
      </li>
    </ul>    
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>
