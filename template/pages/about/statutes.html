    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Article 7 - General Assembly</h2>
<p>
    The supreme body of the association is the General Assembly of the
    active members, which meets in ordinary session once a year.
    Furthermore the General Assembly meets as often as necessary in
    extraordinary session when convened by the President of the association, at
    the request of the majority of the Board of Directors, or at the request of
    at least 25% of active members.
</p>
<p>
    The General Assembly can be arranged, as chosen by the Board of Directors,
    either in the form of a gathering of people or in the form of a remote
    meeting.
</p>
<p>
    The General Assembly will vote on issues using an electronic system over
    the internet. Each active member has one vote, and there is no tiering or exclusion.
</p>
<p>
    The activities report and the financial report, as well as any
    information relating to the agenda will be sent to members by email or
    otherwise at least
    7 days before the meeting.
</p>
<p>
    Any member of the association may place an item on the agenda; any item for
    the agenda must be received by the Secretary no later than 8 days before the
    meeting. The General Assembly deliberates on all the items on the agenda as
    amended.

    members participating.
    In the event of a tie, the sitting President shall have a deciding vote.
</p>
<p>
    For the General Assembly to be validly constituted a quorum of 15% of the
    total number of members must be present or represented. If the General
    Assembly is expected to deliberate on the continued existence of the
    association, the quorum must be 50%. In the absence of a quorum, a new
    General Assembly will be held after at least 7 days and within 30 days, and
    it will then deliberate without quorum.
</p>
<p>
    The General Assembly elects the Board of Directors.
</p>


<h2>Article 8 - Board of Directors</h2>
<p>
    The Board of Directors ensures that the decisions taken by the General
    Assembly are executed.
</p>
<p>
    The association is managed by its Board of Directors, composed of 5 members,
    elected by the General Assembly from among the active members. In the event
    that the number of Directors falls below that number, the Board must co-opt
    a replacement member without undue delay.
</p>
<p>
    Members of the Board of Directors are elected for 3 years. Retiring
    directors
    are eligible for re-election.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a vacancy, the Board of Directors provides for
    temporary replacement of its members by cooption. Cooptions
    have to be ratified by the next General Assembly to become
    permanent. A coopted member's mandate comes to an end at the end of the
    mandate of the
    member he/she replaces.
</p>
<p>
    The number of Directors employed by a single company or different companies
    with the same ultimate ownership or under the same ultimate control must be
    less than 50% of the total number of Board Members. In the event that a
    Director steps down causing this rule to be breached, a replacement Director
    must be co-opted without undue delay. In the event that a Director accepts a
    new position with a company causing this rule to be breached, he or she must
    step down and a replacement co-opted without undue delay. In the event that
    the appointment of a Director following a Board election would cause this
    rule to be breached, the first runner-up who would not cause the rule to be
    breached must be appointed instead. No binding contracts, agreements, or
    payments over 10,000â‚¬ (except where previously contractually agreed) may be
    approved whilst in breach of this rule.
</p>
<p>
    The decisions of the Board of Directors shall be taken by a simple majority
    of present or represented members. In the event of a tie for any action, the
    President shall have
    a deciding vote.
</p>
<p>
    The Board of Directors must approve any contract signed between the
    association and individuals or legal entities.
</p>
<p>
    Any member of the Board of Directors can be removed at any time by the
    General Assembly, meeting in ordinary or extraordinary session.
    A member of the Board of Directors can be removed by the Board after three
    unexplained absences from meetings of the Board of Directors.
</p>
<p>
    Any members of the association, or any non-members, may attend meetings of
    the Board of Directors at the Board's request, if the Board of Directors
    considers their presence is required. These persons have only an advisory
    capacity, and therefore do not participate in the voting.
</p>

<h2>Article 9 - Executive Committee</h2>

    of the association.
