<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>
    Finances are good. We are progressing with the move to new accountants
    but are still bound to the old ones for the year 2023. This transition
    wasn&rsquo;t finalized in 2024. We have a comfortable buffer of money we
    can use to experiment with small events in different places.

    PGDay UK is also run under the PostgreSQL Europe umbrella, but is
    organised and run under agreement by Slonik Enterprises Ltd, a private
    limited company in the UK owned and run by Dave Page and Devrim Gunduz
    on a not for profit basis. PostgreSQL Europe pays a management fee for
    each event to cover costs of running the company, and provides bootstrap
    funding to enable the payment of venue deposits etc. All proceeds are
    returned to PostgreSQL following the end of the event.

    the management fee, and &pound;6,720.00 to cover the venue deposit.
