      PostgreSQL Europe hosts and supports a large number of events
      around Europe. Some of these are arranged by the core PostgreSQL
      Europe team, and others are run by other teams around the area,
      supported by PostgreSQL Europe in different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in hosting an event in Europe and would
      like some help, please check out our section
      on <a href="/events/services/">Event services</a> to see in which
      ways we can help you out!
    </p>
    <p>
      As a PostgreSQL community organisation, <strong>all</strong>
      PostgreSQL Europe hosted and supported events follow the PostgreSQL
      <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/community/recognition/#conferences">Community
	Conference Guidelines</a>, aimed at making sure there is a
	fair treatment of all attendees, speakers and sponsors of the events.
